a == b      //equal to
a === b     //strictly equal to (same type, as well as same value)   <- "3.0" == 3 gives true, "3.0" === 3 gives false, as "3.0" is a string
a ~~~ b     //Fuzzily equal to (same type, don't care about value)   <- "3.0" == 3 gives false, "3.0" === 3 gives false, none of them have the same type
a != b      //not equal to
a !== b     //not strictly equal to
a !~~ b     //not fuzzily equal to

//Logical operators
-a          //negates the value of a  -6 -> 6, "-6" causes an error (at the present)

a & b       //a and b
a | b       //a or b
a ^ b       //a xor b
a and b     //a and b
a or b      //a or b
a xor b     //a xor b
a ? b : c   //if a then b else c              <-ternary operator
a ?: b      //if a is true, then a, else b    <-elvis operator, equivalent to a ? a : b, but does not evaluate 'a' twice
a ?? b      //if a null, then b, else a       <-null coalescence operator, equivalent to a!=null ? a : b, but does not evaluate 'a' twice

//Variables and assignment
var a       //initialise as 0.
a = 5       //reassign a as 5.
b = 3       //implicitly define b as 3
check a     //evaluates the truthiness of a, thorwing an error if it is false

ie:

//(Continues executing while the condition is true)

ie:

//prefacing with 'do' causes the body to be executed one or more times
a = 10

for (increment variable) ("where" | "when") (condition) "do" (increment operation):

ie:

  print(x)
//explicitly defining the increment operation

//basically a while loop with a defined increment and implicitly declared variable

///   for x in 10:
