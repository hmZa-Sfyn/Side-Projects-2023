//test different for loop examples
//1) no conditional or incremental for x, (incremental is implicit):

for var x:
  print(x)

//0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, ...


//2) only conditional (incremental is implicit):
for var x when x < 10:
  print(x)

//0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

//3) conditional and incremental

for var x when x < 10 do x = x+2:
  print(x)

//0, 2, 4, 6, 8

//4) only incremental

for var x do x = x+2:
  print(x)

//0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, ...
